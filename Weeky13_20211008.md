The old artist always paints concentratively and carefully,but life is not like this.

I have already been  back to home for two weeks. 

Look back , actually i haven't do a lot of things that i planned originally.

Such as get more offers and resign with no work entanglement,and then i can dive all my heart into something new .

Now i can not be easy and relaxed like former holidays, i have pressure from job and feature.

Life is boring , you have to find something interesting.

I want money and freedom.
