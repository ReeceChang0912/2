This week is and the next six weeks i have to attend a class stuck in a classroom .

It is a really a tired trip, ans  i take two days to sleep recover from it .When you settle down ,you feel hungry and sleepy. And the trip really cost me a lot ,cause i can live in the Youth hotel and have to pay the car fee and accommodation on myself. Tickets and souvenirs are also a big expenditure. 

It is nice ,this trip make me easy ,and feel empty in my head ,i can fight again  to learn ,to code ,to read. It just make me easy to learn without so many shackles. A empty head is really a amazing thing. 

I need to pick up FE again recently. I think.    

Most of its work can be done in a week , but the school forces us to stay there wasting time .So we  should do something worthwhile but deferring to have the internship is really a bad thing. I think i am basely ready for it.
