Weekly31  Graduation 

This week, somehow i can say that i am a bachelor , but i still have some trivial things about school. 

It's been 4 years from my Higher Education Admission Test, and i still remember yesterday four years ago, LRC had a new haircut, GJC treated us a meal , we play basketball at school... So many memories, and soon i went to Dali. 

Today , i have come to a new life phase , i have to face society and interestingly my father try to introduce me a girl which he has a friendship with her father. I surprise me a little, at first, i think he must be joking, but later he repeated this thing, and talk seriously,so i am still  thinking of it . I am a little confused , i don't know what to do next .And i wonder what will happen in the next.
