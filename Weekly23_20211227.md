Weekly 23 

Maybe i am a truly a fucking idiot in romance, you can call me a straight boy, i just think too much . 

 I sleep early this week, between 22 and 23. And  i gradually find back a easy mood. But i am afraid of  my mom, especially when i am doing something she do not understand , than she will misunderstood you, you know that kind of feeling ,so bad.

And tomorrow will be the last day of this year , i have a new year resolution .
