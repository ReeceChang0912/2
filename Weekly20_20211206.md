Week 20

This week i am back to the normal life of learning, if  you have a long-term dream, then you should seize spare time to  chasing it .

I have to say one principle that i learned in internship is really illustrative. 

You know i am a vigorous person, so why not go visiting Guangzhou instead of staying in the dorm ?

Saturday:

​	Thinking of graduation design,

 	Getting in touch with the research teacher 

​	 Having Dongbei Food
