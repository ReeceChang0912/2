## Code 

Monday： 

​	Vue

   1. I found that reading the official document is a effective way to understand the key idea of a new technique . 

   2. Vue is good at binding data with original Dom element , you can use V-bind  which is called a Vue instruction to achieve uploading simultaneously . As long as you store it in the data(){ } function as a variable ,you can pass it through between  parent and child components . And if the element is an Input Box, you can make the property value to be two-direction binding which is cool.

      But in React you have to flow the state .And can only use the setState().

   3. A big difference I found is that when we use vue ,and in its script, we can not declare an arrow function while we just need to use the arrow function to make the this point at our class component if we do not use bind() to change the this pointer.

   4.  Actually I do not think there is a big difference about passing parameters to the child between parent and child. In Vue ,we just need to  declare in the props {}.In React we use this.props to get the value and usually  we combine with destruction .

   5. JSX is almost the same in Vue and React except Vue is in the <template> while React is in the  render( ) 

   6. If you want a parent to handle child, Vue we usually use $emit() ,

      React we usually use refs.
