Actually i do  not want to go back to school. And when i was back to school yesterday , i found out that many people not coming back. 

But anyway living in kunming is not my life right know , i can have a job in kunming ,and i still do not have my owm family there .It is my beloved parents' life. I am young and i have dream . I also want to start a business and become rich in a night. Who does not want ?

Thursday :

these days, many news about software engineers died due to working life unbalance.  I am thinking starting a business recently. I want to build a place where can help people work normally and fight for their rights. And can create a place where coder can communicate , can share resources,and what's more , can learn how to learn cs,not like the fucking CSDN .
