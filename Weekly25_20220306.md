This two week i am working on my  diploma project, trying to run code and get a model. It do take lots of energy.  I am ready to run it on a GPU server.

Then i am coding RN, though not much , but i am gradually familiar to it .

Third as you have decided , working towards that direction. The more pain , the more happiness later. 

Thoughts:

â€‹		Yesterday my bro's father passed away due to a car accident, i am sad very much , after all i have a meet with his father when we first met in University, he was a nice guy . At the same time i am concerned of my father , I wish him safe and healthy all the time . 

Life is cruel ,who knows what will happen next , love who love you right away.
