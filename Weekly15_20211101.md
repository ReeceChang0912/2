What is fair to everyone? 

The answer is Time. 

This afternoon i almost don't want to study, because i am in a rush.

Look back, a time a little is an more appropriate way to do learning.

Be patient. Slow is fast.

Besides learning, this week relationships are the problems that confuse me. I don't want to get along with the relationships that is plastic. And when i am needed,  they turn to me for help. And  it is hard to get along with them for their scrupulosity. I just don't like.
