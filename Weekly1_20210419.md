# Week1

## Code 

Monday： 

​	Vue

   1. I found that reading the official document is a effective way to understand the key idea of a new technique . 

   2. Vue is good at binding data with original Dom element , you can use V-bind  which is called a Vue instruction to achieve uploading simultaneously . As long as you store it in the data(){ } function as a variable ,you can pass it through between  parent and child components . And if the element is an Input Box, you can make the property value to be two-direction binding which is cool.

      But in React you have to flow the state .And can only use the setState().

   3. A big difference I found is that when we use vue ,and in its script, we can not declare an arrow function while we just need to use the arrow function to make the this point at our class component if we do not use bind() to change the this pointer.

   4.  Actually I do not think there is a big difference about passing parameters to the child between parent and child. In Vue ,we just need to  declare in the props {}.In React we use this.props to get the value and usually  we combine with destruction .

   5. JSX is almost the same in Vue and React except Vue is in the <template> while React is in the  render( ) 

   6. If you want a parent to handle child, Vue we usually use $emit() ,

      React we usually use refs.

Wednesday：

  1. Today and yesterday i mainly leaning Vue3 and its new characteristic .

  2. Setup( )  and defineComponent is really a big change  

  3. You will change LifeCycle Hooks into composition Api which should be put into setUp() and pass a arrow function as parameter.

  4. Another specious variety is About Data Binding.  Vue3 is using Proxy.

      a. if ref() pass in an array or an object 

      b. reactive() do return a Proxy   which  usually return  with Reflect

      c. computed({ })  also return a Proxy 

	5. watch is a little bit complicated , I think watchEvent() is a parse suger to watch when immediate ==true .
	
	6. About the life cycle  I am thinking why we use new way ,just because they are executed earlier than those in  Vue2  ?
	
	7. setup is a cool ,because its return can mix the data(){} and use {attrs ,emit ,slots } and props 
	
	8. setup is different from data(){  }  in data we do not need return {} to export the variable to <temple>
   9. v-model is aimed at form while v:bind can have 3 function 

      a.  dynamical class  usually with backend data 

      b.  passing props 

      c. all kinds of properties
