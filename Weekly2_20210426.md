​	1 Mainly focus on English , but before sleep yesterday, i suddenly realize , if  i do not go to study overseas , and want to work there , i have to have at least 1-2 years work experience and then my language does not work and if quit i have to prepare another year. After all it is a accumulating process, and the job it is very important to me . I have to be a coder and i also want to be a coder. And  after tomorrow   , i have to divide half day to my FE, and code more, read more.

It pulls me back to the first year that i was in Scut , a lot of memories strike to my head. Oh, my god, how time flies, two years passes. I am still love GuangZhou's rainy days. It makes the city clean and full of moisture, which i can breath well and because of the rain , the world suddenly become quiet. I do love quiet and refreshing. I can have an indifferent state of mind. I suddenly go back to my literature and romance and tranquility. It is good.
