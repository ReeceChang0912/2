## Week 21

This week almost finished the book <How javaScript work> and the physical test so i have no too much thing to do ,but i have a date with a sister , but i am uncertain , somehow i want to disseminate the pigeon , but going back home is also not what i wished , because something bad in memory .

And way i can add something in my Vlog of GuangZhou and university life, i went to eat the 猪杂 on Sunday.
