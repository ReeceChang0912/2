Weekly 14 

Monday: 

Today i reviewed several questions that most common in FE interview , after internship i realized why these points are important.And thanks to my reading about the Good part of Javascript, i can solve these console.log problems.

What's more, today i begin to learn the principle of economics , it is taught by a famous Tsing hua University professor .

later:

Finnaly, i have already finished the Good part of Javascript, and i collect some questions i almost forget ,because they are so easy to forget ,on contrast ,they are very important. When i was interning,  i use them less, but it does not mean that they are not important,  how to say, i think they a the "技术" we called , and we should improve it when we get out of “业务 ”for a while.

The first time i realize what it is learning systemically, after senior high school, i seldom read textbooks, but now it shows  it beneficial to reading textbooks, which work effectively on programming and coding.

Today  it is the last day of October , the leaves falls down from the tree, i sit on the window , watching it dancing , fell the flow if time ,it is so concrete, how time flies , this year is passing.

Remember keep looking , don't settle. Only when  you look back, you can collect the dots.
