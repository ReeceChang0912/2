Weekly 9

How time flies!

It has been two months since i get offer to MT.

This week is most about CAD which is a software used to design products. On the code level what we need to do is to somehow achieve some entity such as circle of it by programming in C++. Though i do  not like C++ that much ,i have to say it is indeed a rigid language. And because of algorithm , which i usually write in C++, it is ok , but i do love weak type language like python and javascript.
